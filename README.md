#Movie Trailer Website Project

Movie Trailer Website Project 

This project builds a Movie Trailer Website using a Python program that deplays my favorite movies and by clicking on a movie its trailer plays. This project was built by writing server-side code in Python to store a list of movie instances in an array which includes the movie title, poster image URL, and trailer URL. When the Python script is run, these data is rendered on a web page and allow users to review the movies and watch the trailers

How to Run this Project
1.  Download the project zip file to your computer and unzip the file. Or clone this repository to your desktop.
2.  Open the entertainment_center.py in Python then run the module.
3.  Your default browser should launch a new tab displaying the movie trailer website.
    
the following files should be in the same directory for the program to run:
1.	entertainment_center.py - main file to run
2.	media.py - contains the class Movie 
3.	fresh_tomatoes.py - creates the data to HTML file for the website
